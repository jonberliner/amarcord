# Amacord Project
*note:* if you have a memory to add or see that you want to riff on, but github seems too confusing or intimidating, please text or email a memory, and someone will be sure to add it.


### what
shared memory bank to add to, look back on, and enjoy

### why
I (Jon Berliner) have been through some rough stuff in life and am processing trauma.  Ask each other for specifics before asking me, please.  
I'd prefer you to help me as I process by taking 5 min to do something happy and positive rather than longer to re-explain unhappy stuff in the past.
I want you to add to a doc of shared experiences so that we can remember them for the murky beauty they are, rather than framed in defiance to abusers or argued over exactly what happened.  Memory doesn't work that way.  Enjoy the beautiful blur of vibes instead.  Watch people discuss different angles of the same event and see how little journaling down specific parts of a memory matters.
+ Friends gave me nearl all my happy memories.  I don't want stories about me.  I want all of you to capture memories about US.
+ Help me process a ton of trauma by making something beautiful, rather than shaking heads and telling how awful it was.  It wasn't awful, because we've had all the great moments we've had/

## What, but this time a bit longer
+ shared document with stories.  getting details exact is NOT the point - do not argue over what happened.  Just add your angle to a shared experience.
+ If you see a story you were part of but remember it differently, add you're angle!  Have fun trying to figure out who was there, when it was, why we did it, why YOU personally did it.
+ Jump in to tag yourself - don't take offense if someone didn't tag you.  We love each other - I promise that if I missed you, it's not because I think less of you.  I just didn't remember, and will be that much happier to be reminded that I shared an experience with YOU also.
+ they don't need to include me.  Watch with wonder how just being brought back to certain contexts will open up more opportunities for memories to pour out
+ DON'T try to remember the whole thing - the point is that we can put in small individual efforts, and put together a rich picture of a shared lived experience that no one, no matter how strong a gaslight brought on you, can take away, so long as we have access to this doc.
+ You may see memories from people that don't know you.  That's okay!  You're wonderful people.  If I can talk about abuse in the light to all you guys, you can be brave and talk about a few wonderful moment's you've had, even if you talk about them in front of wonderful friends' wonderful friends.

## sigh...why github, you coding dorkwad?
+ i think in bullet points, and github uses this format called markdown which makes it easier to write thoughts in a bullet format rather than prose format like docs
+ you can "make a pull request" to add/edit stuff from multiple people doing their own thing, without worrying about overwriting or messing up docs
+ pull requests are essentially asking if it's cool to update the main doc with your story.  it gives everyone the ability to mess with their experiences while not worrying about messing up the main doc of shared experiences.
+ github keeps track of all the changes to a doc - it could be cool to go back and see the history of this if it takes off
+ just text me or something and I can change it to a google doc if need be.
+ to try the github, ask someone that uses it and they'll help set you up (ask berliner, adam, joey v, zach for starting points).

# Memories
+ (Jon Berliner) The Friendsgiving crew cheltenham friends were the closest thing I had to family in high school.  When Gabe's family sold the house, I felt like I lost my family home.  There was a night we went over and "jammed" aka riley and gabe jammed on piano and that indian accordian thinger (name please), and the rest of us got to sing along and do drum circles.  someone, i think adam, brought out yarn and ran around the room, spinning a web around all of us.  i remember feeling nearly delirious with joy - sincerely internally on the edge of talking in tongues, while onthe outside reminding myself to keep some of that joy to myself, because i didn't want to ruin the moment by making it about me.
    + tagging: Gabe, Riley, Adam, Berliner, Cheltenham kids (encourage you to add an angle and fill in tags!)

+ (Jon Berliner) I asked Riley how to hop from rock to rock when water hiking (my family would never let us do family activities growing up - only watching movies or tv together, or going to my mom's parents' house in toledo were allowed - so I had to learn how to appreciate nature from a combo of middle school PEAK trip (not to be confused with Sam "Don't Tell me What's Real" Kassel's peak trip at the Soltrin cabin)), some curated nature walks at Camp Ramah, and winging it trying to keep up with all you guys' awesome naturing abilities.  Riley looked confused laughed, shrugged his shoulders, and said something along the lines of "uuuh, you kinda just walk!" and laughed.  Thanks for making it a joyous moment instead of one I felt embarassed to ask about
    + Also, asked Riley how to do a flip once, and he told me "try really really really hard."  I, actually really sincerely, use that advice for so many things in life still.  It's a hilariously effective way to teach yourself how to do something.  Thanks, Riley!

+ (Jon Berliner) at some point at Camp Ramah or during a meet up at a USY event, Deshields and I had a discussion about perching ourself on chairs as the most comfortable way to sit.  I can't remember if I started "perching" before or after we talked about it, but that convo still pops up in my head every single time.

+ (Jon Berliner) Three Scoot Sunday was our Razor scooter gang.  Zach and Bowman ended up getting harassed by cops for scootin' like the hoodlums they are at pre-dawn hours from elementary school to elementary school.  They were being grilled by cops about if they were breaking into cars and stealing stuff.  They told the cops they were scooting around drinking coffee and visiting schools.  The cop let them off, telling them that was so dumb that they couldn't possibly be making it up.

+ (Laura PHP) We spoke about a lot of things.

+ (JB) I was at summer camp around 10, my first summer.  I was walking with Capecci to Friday night services at Ramah, both rocking our finest khaki bottoms (mine were shorts, I think).  I mumbled "looks like the Dairy Queen burnt down again" drolly, don't remember if there was a reason why.  Pech ended up wheezing with laughter.

+ (JB) Diane's basement drinking Smoked beers Joe brought to us from Philly Beer week.  Pretty sure I was buzzed at this point when we made up my high school yearbook quote "A chair-eating bear is a bear eating chair."  I attributed it to "Honest" Abe Lincoln.
