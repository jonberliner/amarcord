# Amarcord Project
*note:* if you have a memory to add or see that you want to riff on, but github seems too confusing or intimidating, please text or email a memory, and someone will be sure to add it.


### what
shared memory bank to add to, look back on, and enjoy

### why
I (Jon Berliner) have been through some rough stuff in life and am processing trauma.  Ask each other for specifics before asking me, please.  
I'd prefer you to help me as I process by taking 5 min to do something happy and positive rather than longer to re-explain unhappy stuff in the past.
I want you to add to a doc of shared experiences so that we can remember them for the murky beauty they are, rather than framed in defiance to abusers or argued over exactly what happened.  Memory doesn't work that way.  Enjoy the beautiful blur of vibes instead.  Watch people discuss different angles of the same event and see how little journaling down specific parts of a memory matters.
+ Friends gave me nearl all my happy memories.  I don't want stories about me.  I want all of you to capture memories about US.
+ Help me process a ton of trauma by making something beautiful, rather than shaking heads and telling how awful it was.  It wasn't awful, because we've had all the great moments we've had/

## What, but this time a bit longer
+ shared document with stories.  getting details exact is NOT the point - do not argue over what happened.  Just add your angle to a shared experience.
+ If you see a story you were part of but remember it differently, add you're angle!  Have fun trying to figure out who was there, when it was, why we did it, why YOU personally did it.
+ Jump in to tag yourself - don't take offense if someone didn't tag you.  We love each other - I promise that if I missed you, it's not because I think less of you.  I just didn't remember, and will be that much happier to be reminded that I shared an experience with YOU also.
+ they don't need to include me.  Watch with wonder how just being brought back to certain contexts will open up more opportunities for memories to pour out
+ DON'T try to remember the whole thing - the point is that we can put in small individual efforts, and put together a rich picture of a shared lived experience that no one, no matter how strong a gaslight brought on you, can take away, so long as we have access to this doc.
+ You may see memories from people that don't know you.  That's okay!  You're wonderful people.  If I can talk about abuse in the light to all you guys, you can be brave and talk about a few wonderful moment's you've had, even if you talk about them in front of wonderful friends' wonderful friends.

## sigh...why github, you coding dorkwad?
+ i think in bullet points, and github uses this format called markdown which makes it easier to write thoughts in a bullet format rather than prose format like docs
+ you can "make a pull request" to add/edit stuff from multiple people doing their own thing, without worrying about overwriting or messing up docs
+ pull requests are essentially asking if it's cool to update the main doc with your story.  it gives everyone the ability to mess with their experiences while not worrying about messing up the main doc of shared experiences.
+ github keeps track of all the changes to a doc - it could be cool to go back and see the history of this if it takes off
+ just text me or something and I can change it to a google doc if need be.
+ to try the github, ask someone that uses it and they'll help set you up (ask berliner, adam, joey v, zach for starting points).

# Memories
+ (Jon Berliner) The Friendsgiving crew cheltenham friends were the closest thing I had to family in high school.  When Gabe's family sold the house, I felt like I lost my family home.  There was a night we went over and "jammed" aka riley and gabe jammed on piano and that indian accordian thinger (name please), and the rest of us got to sing along and do drum circles.  someone, i think adam, brought out yarn and ran around the room, spinning a web around all of us.  i remember feeling nearly delirious with joy - sincerely internally on the edge of talking in tongues, while onthe outside reminding myself to keep some of that joy to myself, because i didn't want to ruin the moment by making it about me.
    + tagging: Gabe, Riley, Adam, Berliner, Cheltenham kids (encourage you to add an angle and fill in tags!)

+ (Jon Berliner) I asked Riley how to hop from rock to rock when water hiking (my family would never let us do family activities growing up - only watching movies or tv together, or going to my mom's parents' house in toledo were allowed - so I had to learn how to appreciate nature from a combo of middle school PEAK trip (not to be confused with Sam "Don't Tell me What's Real" Kassel's peak trip at the Soltrin cabin)), some curated nature walks at Camp Ramah, and winging it trying to keep up with all you guys' awesome naturing abilities.  Riley looked confused laughed, shrugged his shoulders, and said something along the lines of "uuuh, you kinda just walk!" and laughed.  Thanks for making it a joyous moment instead of one I felt embarassed to ask about
    + Also, asked Riley how to do a flip once, and he told me "try really really really hard."  I, actually really sincerely, use that advice for so many things in life still.  It's a hilariously effective way to teach yourself how to do something.  Thanks, Riley!

+ (Jon Berliner) at some point at Camp Ramah or during a meet up at a USY event, Deshields and I had a discussion about perching ourself on chairs as the most comfortable way to sit.  I can't remember if I started "perching" before or after we talked about it, but that convo still pops up in my head every single time.

+ (Jon Berliner) Three Scoot Sunday was our Razor scooter gang.  Zach and Bowman ended up getting harassed by cops for scootin' like the hoodlums they are at pre-dawn hours from elementary school to elementary school.  They were being grilled by cops about if they were breaking into cars and stealing stuff.  They told the cops they were scooting around drinking coffee and visiting schools.  The cop let them off, telling them that was so dumb that they couldn't possibly be making it up.

+ (Laura PHP) We spoke about a lot of things.

+ (JB) Schwartzy and I would sit back to back in his basement and talk to eachother exclusively through text.  No talking allowed.

+ (JB) I was at summer camp around 10, my first summer.  I was walking with Capecci to Friday night services at Ramah, both rocking our finest khaki bottoms (mine were shorts, I think).  I mumbled "looks like the Dairy Queen burnt down again" drolly, don't remember if there was a reason why.  Pech ended up wheezing with laughter.

+ (JB) Diane's basement drinking Smoked beers Joe brought to us from Philly Beer week.  Pretty sure I was buzzed at this point when we made up my high school yearbook quote "A chair-eating bear is a bear eating chair."  I attributed it to "Honest" Abe Lincoln.

+ (JB) Drop in and drop in at Gabe's house.  The first time someone hung out in the garage, they "had" to drop in on the halfpipe he built.  I don't know how to skate, but whatever let's try.  I ended up stomping on the board, freaking out and grabbing the garage rails thinger on the ceiling, hanging with one hand on it in the air, and then falling into near middle the ramp.  My tailbone was not happy, but it was really funny.
    + JB, Gabe

+ (Adam Drake) Sitting on the roof - a green flair in the sky to the south west perhaps a streak perhaps a burst
    + JB, Lisa F

+ (Adam Drake) Lying in JB's extra bed (Ben's ?) trying to go to sleep on a weekend sleepover - JB recommends I imagine a dancing icecream cone. Some time goes by and he asks me how I imagined it. I said there was an ice cream cone in a room - digital 70s technicolor color schemes - it was grooving. JB said his was a grid of infinite expanding ice cream cones dancing in space. I frequently use his ice cream cones in times of sleepy troubles.
    + JB
    + (JB riffing): Adam, how old were we?  Earliest things I can remember from our sleepovers was discussing the universe and if it's infinite or how it's going to end and how small we are around 12-13.  Born explorers of the infinite, bb!


+ (Adam Drake) bags of sunflower seeds - endless foot spirals down and around elizabeth into the night - why never ranch? always original.
    
+ (JB) LeShawn and I were discussing how people who have been through a lot of shit are, in Shawn's words, "hoarders of thoughts."  This turned into a discussion about generational continuation of abuse, and the plight of the progeny of pimps.  Realized a pimp is a "hoarder of thots."  Good times pacing the hallway up and down together

+ (Sarah) We decided to have a picnic on the water for my birthday last year because it was one of the first sunny days of spring, walked for hours to find food but couldn't find anywhere that was open except the Lebenese deli. Got way too much (incredible) food, set up the most beautiful picnic at the park, hung out by the water until 15 minutes later we each realized at the same time that we both had blue lips and were pretending not to shiver because we didn't want to ruin the moment and laughed about it. (But then moved the picnic to 832)
