+ (Adam Drake) Sitting on the roof - a green flair in the sky to the south west perhaps a streak perhaps a burst

    + (JB) I still can't convince myself that was anything besids a UFO.  that shit shot up into the sky so fast.


+ (Jon Berliner) The Friendsgiving crew cheltenham friends were the closest thing I had to family in high school.  When Gabe's family sold the house, I felt like I lost my family home.  There was a night we went over and "jammed" aka riley and gabe jammed on piano and that indian accordian thinger (name please), and the rest of us got to sing along and do drum circles.  someone, i think adam, brought out yarn and ran around the room, spinning a web around all of us.  i remember feeling nearly delirious with joy - sincerely internally on the edge of talking in tongues, while onthe outside reminding myself to keep some of that joy to myself, because i didn't want to ruin the moment by making it about me.

+ (Jon Berliner) I asked Riley how to hop from rock to rock when water hiking (my family would never let us do family activities growing up - only watching movies or tv together, or going to my mom's parents' house in toledo were allowed - so I had to learn how to appreciate nature from a combo of middle school PEAK trip (not to be confused with Sam "Don't Tell me What's Real" Kassel's peak trip at the Soltrin cabin)), some curated nature walks at Camp Ramah, and winging it trying to keep up with all you guys' awesome naturing abilities.  Riley looked confused laughed, shrugged his shoulders, and said something along the lines of "uuuh, you kinda just walk!" and laughed.  Thanks for making it a joyous moment instead of one I felt embarassed to ask about
    + Also, asked Riley how to do a flip once, and he told me "try really really really hard."  I, actually really sincerely, use that advice for so many things in life still.  It's a hilariously effective way to teach yourself how to do something.  Thanks, Riley!

+ (Jon Berliner) at some point at Camp Ramah or during a meet up at a USY event, Deshields and I had a discussion about perching ourself on chairs as the most comfortable way to sit.  I can't remember if I started "perching" before or after we talked about it, but that convo still pops up in my head every single time.

+ (Jon Berliner) Three Scoot Sunday was our Razor scooter gang.  Zach and Bowman ended up getting harassed by cops for scootin' like the hoodlums they are at pre-dawn hours from elementary school to elementary school.  They were being grilled by cops about if they were breaking into cars and stealing stuff.  They told the cops they were scooting around drinking coffee and visiting schools.  The cop let them off, telling them that was so dumb that they couldn't possibly be making it up.

+ (Laura PHP) We spoke about a lot of things.

+ (JB) Schwartzy and I would sit back to back in his basement and talk to eachother exclusively through text.  No talking allowed.

+ (JB) I was at summer camp around 10, my first summer.  I was walking with Capecci to Friday night services at Ramah, both rocking our finest khaki bottoms (mine were shorts, I think).  I mumbled "looks like the Dairy Queen burnt down again" drolly, don't remember if there was a reason why.  Pech ended up wheezing with laughter.

+ (JB) Diane's basement drinking Smoked beers Joe brought to us from Philly Beer week.  Pretty sure I was buzzed at this point when we made up my high school yearbook quote "A chair-eating bear is a bear eating chair."  I attributed it to "Honest" Abe Lincoln.

+ (JB) Drop in and drop in at Gabe's house.  The first time someone hung out in the garage, they "had" to drop in on the halfpipe he built.  I don't know how to skate, but whatever let's try.  I ended up stomping on the board, freaking out and grabbing the garage rails thinger on the ceiling, hanging with one hand on it in the air, and then falling into near middle the ramp.  My tailbone was not happy, but it was really funny.

+ (JB) One of my first dates with Sarah at Gold star beer counter, Sarah told me the story about how her grandpa tried to kill himself by starving himself, but didn’t realize how long it would take.  Sarah’s aunt called her dad perplexed and told him dad is trying to starve himself.  When her dad, Joe, called his dad and told him, there was a pause on the phone and then 
…son, I’m so hungry.”
    + (Sarah) You almost cancelled because you said you had hives (lol). But I didn’t care. Neither of us had eaten anything so you ordered me a sandwich before I got there. I remember the yellow glow of the place really clearly. You were sitting eating a sandwich and I felt like you were really happy to see me. I was really happy to see you. You told me about some of the stuff you worked on at Princeton. But it was mostly me talking that night about my grandpa that I remember. You looked really into it. I felt like it was one of the first times I thought you might really like me. I also remember the sandwich being better than it had any right to be. We were both surprised.

I realized I need this girl in my life.   Funniest date story I’ve ever heard.  Maybe the best date I’ve ever had.  I left SWOONING.
I had a “grape beer” and a pesto chicken sandwich.

+ (Adam Drake) I remember the first time we were making a plan to hang out waiting for busses in the parking lot at EP - we had it all planned to do it on a Wednesday early day and somehow I called my mom and asked if I could but we couldn't figure out how to tell her where you lived so she didn't let the hangout happen.

+ (Adam Drake) Lying in JB's extra bed (Ben's ?) trying to go to sleep on a weekend sleepover - JB recommends I imagine a dancing icecream cone. Some time goes by and he asks me how I imagined it. I said there was an ice cream cone in a room - digital 70s technicolor color schemes - it was grooving. JB said his was a grid of infinite expanding ice cream cones dancing in space. I frequently use his ice cream cones in times of sleepy troubles.
    + JB
    + (JB riffing): Adam, how old were we?  Earliest things I can remember from our sleepovers was discussing the universe and if it's infinite or how it's going to end and how small we are around 12-13.  Born explorers of the infinite, bb!


+ (Adam Drake) bags of sunflower seeds - endless foot spirals down and around elizabeth into the night - why never ranch? always original.
    
+ (JB) LeShawn and I were discussing how people who have been through a lot of shit are, in Shawn's words, "hoarders of thoughts."  This turned into a discussion about generational continuation of abuse, and the plight of the progeny of pimps.  Realized a pimp is a "hoarder of thots."  Good times pacing the hallway up and down together

+ (Sarah) We decided to have a picnic on the water for my birthday last year because it was one of the first sunny days of spring, walked for hours to find food but couldn't find anywhere that was open except the Lebenese deli. Got way too much (incredible) food, set up the most beautiful picnic at the park, hung out by the water until 15 minutes later we each realized at the same time that we both had blue lips and were pretending not to shiver because we didn't want to ruin the moment and laughed about it. (But then moved the picnic to 832 Washington)

+ (Merle + Michael Drake)
    + You (JB) showing up for us at my father’s and mom’s shiva.
    + Hours on the phone figuring out big leap’s in life
    + Your trusting me
    + Indian food meals in funky restaurants
        + (JB) what's the name of that Pizza place with the tomato pie's you guys love so much?
    + We take such pleasure in your friendship with Adam
    + Watching you do homework on Adam’s bedroom floor
    + Your infectious laughter
    + Catching up with you at Friendsgiving
    + Hundreds of times dropping or picking Adam up at your home
    + Your joyous manner of expressing yourself
    + Your wild sweaters
    + Your beautiful hugs and willingness to engage with us always

+ (Adam Drake) Senior year in spanish class Sr. Birzes called you out for "doing homework" in class - it was peak tom waits time for you in my memory - you were writing lyrics frantically in every class. She didn't believe that you weren't doing homework. I'm sorry I didn't stand up for you.
    - JB

+ (Adam Drake) I remember the (first?) time you studied for a math test in Mr. Johnson's class and you got a good grade on a test - the huge smile you made. I wonder what it felt like for you then.
    - JB

+ (Adam Drake) The tension of slurpee flavor choices - I learned that coke was best for me. You liked blue raspberry. We ate taquitos, you showed me combos and franks. When it rained my socks would fall off my ankles in my shoe - I hated that. We still got slurpees. Slurpees morphed into gusto's pizza - the tragedy that was the day they stopped serving it.

+ (JB) Adam made Koolaid chicken at Elk Mountain once bc we ran out of something (lime?)  Some of the best chicken I ever had.
    + Elk mountain folk
    
+ (JB) Pushing Desh to "seize the moment" towards the end of Gesher and him telling me that how he wanted to have that particular moment was by reading the bio of Malcolm X.  Still think on that as a primo example of standing your ground for doing your thing.
    + Deshields, JB
    
+ (JB) We would sit in Jon-o's living room and do the ol' replace-the-vodka-with-water routine.  Then go out tipsy and meet up with Jon-os older (I think?) high school friends (names?).  Remember something about them having a blender in their kitchen.  Can't remember if we joked about that or if a kitchenaid blender just really owns the space.
    + Jon-o, JB
    
    + (Lisa) running into you and sarah at sharlene's super late night- we were both so freakin excited to see each other. then also running into each other at that italian place Sauce in the LES late at night. running into you in nyc is my favorite thing ever. every time we shout at each others faces WE NEED TO HANG OUT ALL THE TIME STARTING RIGHT NOW which is totally true. it feels like a hack, like, wait- one of my all time favorite people from my childhood ALSO gets to be here in my adulthood, standing outside some random spot we both went to inside the whirlpool of our regular lives!???? i love that feeling.
